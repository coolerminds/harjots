I began coding in middle school, trying to create javascript clocks and effects mostly, css was like a new paint brush, I'd spend hours exporting assets from Photoshop and laying out content in CSS.
Type a few characters, and suddenly every `button` changes colors on hover. (From blue to... a slightly different blue!) I thought this was the coolest thing in the world.
I still think coding is cool.
Most of my professional titles have included the word "Engineer", but code is my medium and the browser is my favorite design tool. I believe that designing for the web means working _in the medium_ of the webâ€”namely, HTML and CSS. Interactive mediums deserve interactive iteration.
I love working digitally, but when I need to think about gnarly problems, I take my sketchbook and my pen, and I write or draw (sometimes both). Ideally i want to merge my loves of ART into Programming as much as possible.
I currently work at [GM](https://generalmotors.com) as a Senior Design Engineer. Previously, I spent time building things at [Focus Digital Video](https://focusdv.com), [Fridge Media](https://coolerminds.net), and for [myself](https://instagram.com/blahzilla). You can [download my resume here](/downloads/harjots-resume.pdf).
In my free time I play piano and listen to city pop and noodle with synths. I like films about punjab, immgration, and history, and I want to retire one day and make photo books.
