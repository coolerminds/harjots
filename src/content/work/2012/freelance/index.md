I work solo with teams of all sizes on [programming](https://focusdigitalvideo.com) and front-end engineering (plus occasional branding and illustration). I love pairing with orgs in [computer science](/posts/boundaries-map), film making, [photography](https://instagram.com/blahzilla), and music. [Send me an email](mailto:jot@employme.dev) and let's make something great.
